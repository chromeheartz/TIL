# Branching Exercise

1. Make a new folder called `Patronus`
2. Make a new git repo inside the folder (make sure you're not in an existing repo)
3. Create a new file called `patronus.txt` (leave it empty for now)
4. Add and commit the empty file, with the message "add empty patronus file"
5. Immediately make a new branch called `harry` and another branch called `snape` (both based on the master branch)
6. Move to the `harry` branch using the "new" command to change branches.
7. In the `patronus.txt` file, add the following:

   ```
   HARRY'S PATRONUS

      /|       |\
   `__\\       //__'
      ||      ||
    \__`\     |'__/
      `_\\   //_'
      _.,:---;,._
      \_:     :_/
        |@. .@|
        |     |
        ,\.-./ \
        ;;`-'   `---__________-----.-.
        ;;;                         \_\
        ';;;                         |
         ;    |                      ;
          \   \     \        |      /
           \_, \    /        \     |\
             |';|  |,,,,,,,,/ \    \ \_
             |  |  |           \   /   |
             \  \  |           |  / \  |
              | || |           | |   | |
              | || |           | |   | |
              | || |           | |   | |
              |_||_|           |_|   |_|
             /_//_/           /_/   /_/
   ```

8. Add and commit the changes, with the commit message "add harry's stag patronus"
9. Move over to the `snape` branch using the "older" command to change branches.
10. Put the following text in the `patronus.txt` file:

    ```
    SNAPE'S PATRONUS
                       .     _,
                       |`\__/ /
                       \  . .(
                        | __T|
                       /   |
          _.---======='    |
         //               {}
        `|      ,   ,     {}
         \      /___;    ,'
          ) ,-;`    `\  //
         | / (        ;||
         ||`\\        |||
         ||  \\       |||
         )\   )\      )||
         `"   `"      `""
    ```

11. Add and commit the changes on the `snape` branch with the commit message "add snape's doe patronus"
12. Next, create a new branch based upon the `snape` branch called `lily`
13. Move to the `lily` branch
14. Edit the `patronus.txt` file so that it says `LILY'S PATRONUS` at the top instead of
    `SNAPE'S PATRONUS` (leave the doe ascii-art alone)
15. Add and commit the change with the message "add lily's doe patronus"
16. Run a git command to list all branches (you should see 4)
17. **Bonus:** delete the `snape` branch (poor Snape)
