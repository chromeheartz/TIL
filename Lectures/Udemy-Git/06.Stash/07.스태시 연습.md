# Stashing Exercise

1. Initialize a new git repo in a folder
2. Create a file called `diary.txt`. Inside the file, add the following:

   ```
   I love my boss
   ```

3. Add and commit the changes on the `master` branch
4. Create a new branch called `the-truth`. Switch to it.
5. In the `diary.txt` file, erase the contents and instead replace it with:

   ```
   I HATE MY BOSS
   I HATE MY BOSS
   I HATE MY BOSS
   I HATE MY BOSS
   I HATE MY BOSS
   ```

6. Save the file
7. **OH NO!** Your boss is walking towards you! Quick, switch over to the `master` branch!
8. **WHATTT?** The `diary.txt` file still contains our confession? **Quick, stash the changes before your boss sees!!**
9. Your `diary.txt` file should now only contain "I love my boss"
10. As your boss walks by, add more lies to the `diary.txt` file:

    ```
    I love my boss
    I love my boss
    I love my boss
    ```

11. Add and commit your changes on the `master` branch.
12. Now that your boss has left, it's safe to get back to the truth! Switch over to the `the-truth` branch.
13. Retrieve the earlier changes that you stashed (I HATE MY BOSS x 5)
14. Add and commit the changes on the `the-truth` branch
