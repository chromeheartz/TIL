### 📌 Committing Basics Exercise

1. Create a new folder called `Shopping`
2. Initialize a new git repo inside of the `Shopping` folder (make sure you're not already inside of a Git repo!)
3. Make a new file called `yard.txt`
4. Make another new file called `groceries.txt`
5. Make a commit that includes both empty files. The message should be "create yard and groceries lists"
6. In the `yard.txt` file, add the following changes:

   ```
   - 2 bags of potting soil
   - 1 bag of worm castings
   ```

7. In the `groceries.txt` file, add the following:

   ```
   - 4 tomatoes
   - 6 shallots
   - 1 fennel bulb
   ```

8. Make a new commit, including **ONLY the changes from the `groceries.txt` file.** The commit message should be "add ingredients for tomato soup"
9. Make a second commit including **ONLY the changes to the `yard.txt` file.** It should have the commit message "add items needed for garden box"
10. Next up, add the following line to the end of `groceries.txt`

    ```
    - couple of seed potatos
    ```

11. In the `yard.txt` file, change the first line so that it says "**3** bags of potting soil" instead of "2 bags of potting soil"

    ```
    - 3 bags of potting soil
    - 1 bag of worm castings
    ```

12. **Make a commit that includes the changes to BOTH files.** The message should read "add items needed to grow potatoes"
13. **Use a Git command to display a list of the commits. You should see 4!**
